I just got some K-type thermocouples and MAX6675 breakout boards in the mail. It's Christmas in July!  In my previous prototype, I used one thermocouple and one IR thermopile to measure the hive and ambient temperatures, respectively. But that was an apples-to-oranges comparison. With identical thermometry hardware, I should be able to get a better sense of the type of thermoregulation the bees are performing in the hive.  

Here's a wiring diagram showing how the MAX6675 breakout boards are connected to the Raspberry Pi:

The goal is to do as little wiring as possible, so I'm sharing the power (`VCC`) and ground (`GND`) pins as well as the serial clock (`SCK`) and serial output (`SO`) pins across the three breakout boards.  Each breakout has only one unique wire, going to the chip select (`CS`) pin.  This pin is active low according to the [datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX6675.pdf), so you need to set each board's GPIO pin to 0 (and the others to 1) before reading it.
