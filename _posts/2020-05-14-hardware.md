I'm using a super simple setup for hive monitoring.  The brains of the operation is a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspbian.

### Temperature Data Collection

I'm measuring hive temperature with two sensors:

* thermocouple and thermocouple amplifier (MAX6675) for internal hive temp.
* infrared thermopile (TMP006) for ambient temp.

Ideally I'd use two thermocouples, but these are the only sensors I have on hand.

I'm using a [python library](https://github.com/tdack/MAX6675) to read the temperature every ten seconds.  Nothing fancy -- just appending a text file with timestamped readings.  Here's the basic idea:

```python
while True:
    with open("/home/pi/bees/temp.txt", "a") as f:
        dat = datetime.datetime.now()
        temp1, temp2, temp3 = 0, 0, 0
        try:
            temp1 = c_to_f(sensor1.readTempC())
            temp2 = c_to_f(sensor2.readDieTempC())
            temp3 = c_to_f(sensor2.readObjTempC())
        except:
            print "An error occured"
        f.write(','.join([dat, temp1, temp2, temp3]) + "\n")
        time.sleep(10.0)
```

Initially, I wrote the script with the `open` statement outside the loop, like so...

```python
with open("/home/pi/bees/temp.txt", "a") as f:
    while True:
        # ...
```

... to save on the cost of reopening the file for each iteration of the loop.  However, this causes those writes to be bundled into larger writes which is inconvenient when you want the most recent data.  

These sensors are arranged in a crappy box made from plywood and pallet wood. It's ugly as sin.

## Audio Data Collection Setup

Audio is coming from an old Guitar Hero USB mic I cannibalized.

The audio is recorded using [arecord](http://manpages.org/arecord) in a bash script more or less like this:

```bash
while [true]    
    arecord --device sysdefault:CARD=1 --format S16_LE --rate 11025 --channels=1 --duration 3600 out.wav || break;
```

What is this command doing? It's recording an hour (3600 seconds) of mono sound (16 bit samples, little endian) at 11025 samples per second.

Why am I recording at 11025 Hz instead of the standard 44.1kHz? Some papers[^fn-acoustics][^fn-vibratory] indicate that bee communication sounds are composed of a low fundamental frequency between 300 and 600Hz and the corresponding harmonics. Therefore, the Nyquist sampling rate is 1200 Hz, but that makes for some gnarly audio.

Besides, the standard 44.1kHz stereo signal is ~10MB per minute. The mono 11kHz signal is ~1.25 MB per minute, which is a tolerable 1.8GB per day. For data safety and ease of processing, I'm recording the audio data as 1-hour wav files.

#### Networking

The Pi is connected via WLAN to an AirPort Extreme. From the house, I can connect to the network and `ssh` into the Pi to download the data, modify scripts, etc. To keep data collection running after I close the session, I'm running `tmux` and detaching. There are other ways to do this, like `nohup`, `screen`, `disown`, `bg`, etc., but `tmux` is part of my regular workflow.

From my laptop, I can run a small script to switch networks and download the data every so often:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Connecting to beenet..."
networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 beenet password
echo "Downloading data..."
scp pi@raspberrypi.local:~/bees/temp.txt .
echo "Connecting to home network..."
networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 homenet password
```

This data collection scheme is fine for prototyping, but would be very inconvenient for live metrics.

I'm making this thing seem a lot sexier than it really is. Let's see how it actually looks on the inside (without the power supply):

Honestly, the whole prototype is kind of ugly.
